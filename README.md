CV-Site
A creative and interactive way to showcase my Curriculum Vitae (CV) in a modern website format. Visit the live site at https://rorke-melville.github.io/CV-Site/ to explore my professional journey, skills, and experiences.

Overview
This project is a personal portfolio website designed to present my CV in an engaging and visually appealing manner. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, it combines responsive design with dynamic elements to create a user-friendly experience. The site replaces the traditional static CV format with a digital, interactive layout that highlights my education, work experience, skills, and contact information.

Features
Responsive Design: Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) using Bootstrap's grid system.
Interactive Navigation: A sticky navigation bar allows easy access to sections like Home, About, Experience, Education, Skills, and Contact.
Dynamic Content: JavaScript enhances interactivity, such as smooth scrolling and toggleable sections (e.g., the mobile menu).
Modern Styling: Custom CSS paired with Bootstrap provides a clean, professional look with subtle hover effects.
Contact Form: A non-functional form for visitors to send messages directly from the site (Note: Requires backend integration for full functionality).
Downloadable CV: A link to download a traditional CV in PDF format for convenience.
Technologies Used
HTML5: Structures the content and ensures semantic markup for accessibility.
CSS3: Custom styles for layout, typography, and visual enhancements, layered on top of Bootstrap's base styles.
JavaScript: Adds interactivity, including menu toggling and smooth scrolling effects.
Bootstrap 5: Provides a responsive framework, pre-built components (e.g., navbar, buttons), and utility classes.
